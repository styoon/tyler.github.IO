  <h2> Breakdown </h2> 
  <p> 
   Even without knowing the exact format of the Spanish Final,
   you do know that it's going to be comprised of mostly Vocab
   and Grammar. In the past semester, there have been 5 
   Spanish Chapters. The Spanish Vocab should be split evenly 
   among the 5 chapters. Assuming that there are 100 words. 
   
  <h3> Vocab</h3> 
  <p> 
   The joy of having a test on vocab is that you
   only have to memorize the words. That may sound like a 
   daunting task at first, but it only seems difficult. 
   My primary weapon for studying Vocab is Quizlet. The 
   site/ app is able to make sets of flashcard for any topic; 
   flashcards will be similar. Benefits that Quizlet
